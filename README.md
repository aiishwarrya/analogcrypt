## **Simulation Details**

### Tools Used
* eSim: For schematic creation and simulation management
* NGSPICE: For running the transient analysis
* SKY130 PDK: Open-source process design kit for transistor models

### Simulation Setup

The circuit is simulated with the following parameters:
* Power Supply: 1.8V DC to VDD
* Inputs: V(A) and V(B) manually set to 0 and 1 to verify XOR logic
* Simulation Time: 0.5 ms with a time step of 10 μs

### NGSPICE Commands
To plot the output of the XOR circuit along with inputs `A` and `B` in NGSPICE, use the following commands:
```
* Define the transient analysis parameters
.tran 10u 0.5m
* Run the simulation and save outputs
.control
run
plot v(out) v(a) v(b)
.endc
```

## **Expected Results**
<p align="justify">
When the inputs are applied to the gates of the transistors, the combination of NMOS and PMOS pairs is arranged so that the `V(out)` node behaves according to XOR logic. Specifically, if both `V(A)` and `V(B)` are at the same voltage level (either both high or both low), the configuration ensures that V(out) is pulled to a low state (0V). This occurs because either both NMOS transistors conduct, grounding the output, or both PMOS transistors do not conduct, isolating the output from VDD.

However, if the inputs `V(A)` and `V(B)` differ (one high, one low), the transistor configuration allows the output `V(out)` to be pulled high (1.8V). For example, if `V(A)` is high and `V(B)` is low, only one of the NMOS transistors conducts, isolating the output from the ground, while one of the PMOS transistors conducts, connecting `V(out)` to `VDD`. This dual-conductance setup is what enables the output to reach a high state only when the inputs differ, aligning precisely with XOR logic.

This arrangement confirms that the output V(out) toggles in a predictable manner based on the XOR truth table:

* **When both inputs are low (0, 0), the output remains low (0V).**
* **When one input is high and the other is low (0, 1 or 1, 0), the output goes high (1.8V).**
* **When both inputs are high (1, 1), the output is low again (0V).**

This toggling is crucial in cryptographic applications, where XOR gates introduce necessary variability in data encryption. Thus, by implementing this XOR behavior at the transistor level with analog components, your design achieves efficient encryption functionality while remaining energy-efficient and low-power, which is essential for cryptographic hardware in resource-constrained devices.

This expected behavior not only validates the circuit’s functional accuracy but also ensures its reliability in real-world cryptographic systems.

## **Simulation Results**

The following simulation waveforms illustrate the XOR operation for each input combination (00, 01, 10, 11). In each graph, the three lines represent:

- **Red (netA)**: `Input A`
- **Blue (netB)**: `Input B`
- **Green (Vout)**: Output of the XOR operation
  
The transient analysis was performed with a time step of 10 μs over a 0.5 ms duration, capturing the dynamic response of the circuit as inputs toggle. This analysis allows us to observe the XOR logic as it switches the output state based on the values of inputs A and B, validating the expected XOR truth table behavior.

### **Waveform for Input (00)**

</div>
Here, `Input A` is **low (0)**, and `Input B` is **high (1)**. The output toggles to **high (1)**, confirming XOR functionality.

### **Waveform for Input (10)**
<div align="center">
  <img src="images/10.png" alt="output_10" width="700" height="500">
</div>

With `Input A` as **high (1)** and `Input B` as **low (0)**, the output toggles to **high (1)**.

### **Waveform for Input (11)**
<div align="center">
  <img src="images/11.png" alt="output_11" width="700" height="500">
</div>

In this case, both `Input A` and `Input B` are **high (1)**. The output remains **low (0)**, confirming XOR functionality.

## **Conclusion**
The simulation results confirm that the circuit accurately performs XOR logic. This functionality is critical for data encryption and decryption in analog cryptographic circuits. The four output waveforms validate the XOR operation for each input combination, proving the circuit’s suitability for use in hardware cryptography applications.
