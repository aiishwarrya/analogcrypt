## Background
Hardware-based cryptography offers enhanced security over software encryption methods. In this project, we leverage XOR logic, a fundamental operation in many encryption algorithms, to create a compact, efficient, and low-power cryptographic circuit that can be adapted for various security applications. 

### Why XOR?
The XOR operation is widely used in cryptography for its unique property: `A XOR B XOR A = B`. This allows for simple encryption and decryption mechanisms by merely toggling input values.
